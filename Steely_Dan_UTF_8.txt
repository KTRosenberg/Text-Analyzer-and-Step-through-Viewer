CAN'T BUY A THRILL

DO IT AGAIN

In the mornin you go gunnin'
For the man who stole your water 
And you fire till he is done in 
But they catch you at the border 
And the mourners are all singin' 
As they drag you by your feet 
But the hangman isn't hangin' 
And they put you on the street 

You go back Jack do it again 
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round 
You go back Jack do it again 

When you know she's no high climber 
Then you find your only friend 
In a room with your two timer 
And you're sure you're near the end 
Then you love a little wild one 
And she brings you only sorrow 
All the time you know she's smilin' 
You'll be on your knees tomorrow 

Now you swear and kick and beg us 
That you're not a gamblin' man 
Then you find you're back in Vegas 
With a handle in your hand 
Your black cards can make you money 
So you hide them when you're able 
In the land of milk and honey 
You must put them on the table 









DIRTY WORK

Times are hard 
You're afraid to pay the fee 
So you find yourself somebody 
Who can do the job for free 
When you need a bit of lovin' 
Cause your man is out of town 
That's the time you get me runnin' 
And you know I'll be around 

I'm a fool to do your dirty work 
Oh yeah 
I don't wanna do your dirty work 
No more 
I'm a fool to do your dirty work 
Oh yeah 

Light the candle 
Put the lock upon the door 
You have sent the maid home early 
Like a thousand times before 
Like the castle in its corner 
In a medieval game 
I foresee terrible trouble 
And I stay here just the same 







KINGS

Now they lay his body down 
Sad old men who run this town 
I still recall the way 
He led the charge and saved the day 
Blue blood and rain 
I can hear the bugle playin' 

We seen the last of Good King Richard 
Ring out the past his name lives on 
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher 
Raise up your glass to Good King John 

While he plundered far and wide 
All his starving children cried 
And though we sung his fame 
We all went hungry just the same 
He meant to shine 
To the end of the line 

MIDNIGHT CRUISER
Felonius my old friend 
Step on in and let me shake your hand 
So glad that you're here again 
For one more time 
Let your madness run with mine 
Streets still unseen we'll find somehow 
No time is better than now 

Tell me where are you driving 
Midnight cruiser 
Where is your bounty 
Of fortune and fame 
I am another 
Gentlemen loser 
Drive me to Harlem 
Or somewhere the same 

The world that we used to know 
People tell me it don't turn no more 
The places we used to go 
Familiar faces that ain't smilin' like before 
The time of our time has come and gone 
I fear we been waiting too long 

ONLY A FOOL WOULD SAY THAT
A world become one 
Of salads and sun 
Only a fool would say that 
A boy with a plan 
A natural man 
Wearing a white stetson hat 
Unhand that gun begone 
There's no one to fire upon 
If he's holding it high 
He's telling a lie 

I heard it was you 
Talkin' 'bout a world 
Where all is free 
It just couldn't be 
And only a fool would say that 

The man in the street 
Draggin' his feet 
Don't wanna hear the bad news 
Imagine your face 
There is his place 
Standing inside his brown shoes 
You do his nine to five 
Drag yourself home half alive 
And there on the screen 
A man with a dream 

Anybody on the street 
Has murder in his eyes 
You feel no pain 
And you're younger 
Than you realize 

REELIN' IN THE YEARS
Your everlasting summer 
You can see it fading fast 
So you grab a piece of something 
That you think is gonna last 
You wouldn't know a diamond 
If you held it in your hand 
The things you think are precious 
I can't understand 

Are you reelin' in the years 
Stowin' away the time 
Are you gatherin' up the tears 
Have you had enough of mine 

You been tellin' me you're a genius 
Since you were seventeen 
In all the time I've known you 
I still don't know what you mean 
The weekend at the college 
Didn't turn out like you planned 
The things that pass for knowledge 
I can't understand 

I spend a lot of money 
And I spent a lot of time 
The trip we made in Hollywood 
Is etched upon my mind 
After all the things we've done and seen 
You find another man 
The things you think are useless 
I can't understand 

FIRE IN THE HOLE
I decline 
To walk the line 
They tell me that I'm lazy 
Worldly wise 
I realize 
That everybody's crazy 
A woman's voice reminds me 
To serve and not to speak 
Am I myself or just another freak 

Don't you know 
There's fire in the hole 
And nothing left to burn 
I'd like to run out now 
There's nowhere left to turn 

With a cough 
I shake it off 
And work around my yellow stripe 
Should I hide 
And eat my pride 
Or wait until it's good and ripe 
My life is boiling over 
It's happened once before 
I wish someone would open up the door 

Don't you know 
There's fire in the hole 
And nothing left to burn 
I'd like to run out now 
There's nowhere left to turn 

BROOKLYN (OWES THE CHARMER UNDER ME)
A race of angels 
Bound with one another 
A dish of dollars 
Laid out for all to see 
A tower room at Eden Rock 
His golf at noon for free 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me 

His lady's aching 
To bring a body down 
She daily preaches 
On where she wants to be 
An evening with a movie queen 
A face we all have seen 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me 

A case of aces 
Done up loose for dealing 
A piece of island cooling in the sea 
The whole of time we gain or lose 
And power enough to choose 
Brooklyn owes the charmer 
Under me
CHANGE OF THE GUARD
If you listen you can hear it 
It's the laughter in the street 
It's the motion in the music 
And the fire beneath your feet 
All the signs are right this time 
You don't have to try so very hard 
If you live in this world 
You're feelin' the change of the guard 

All the cowboys and your neighbors 
Can you swallow up your pride 
Take your guns off if you're willin' 
And you know we're on your side 
If you wanna get thru the years 
It's high time you played your card 
If you live in this world 
You're feelin' the change of the guard

TURN THAT HEARTBEAT OVER AGAIN
With stocking face I bought a gun 
The plan was set the plan was done 
Looked at my watch and started for the door 
Now the food here ain't so good no more 
And they closed the package store 

Love your mama, love your brother 
Love 'em till they run for cover 
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on 
Cry a jag on me 

Oh Michael Oh Jesus you know I'm not to blame 
You know my reputation for playing a good clean game 
Oh Michael Oh Jesus I'll keep my promise when 
You turn that heartbeat over again 

My poison's named you know my brand 
So please make mine a double, Sam 
Stir it up nice I'll eat it right here 
This highway runs from Paraguay 
And I've just come all the way 


We warned the corpse of William Wright 
Not to cuss and drink all night 
Ticket in hand I saw him laid to rest 
But zombie see and zombie do 
He's here with me and you

COUNTDOWN TO ECSTASY

BODHISATTVA
Bodhisattva
Would you take me by the hand
Bodhisattva
Would you take me by the hand
Can you show me
The shine of your Japan
The sparkle of your china
Can you show me
Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva
I'm gonna sell my house in town
Bodhisattva
I'm gonna sell my house in town
And I'll be there
To shine in your Japan
To sparkle in your China
Yes I'll be there
Bodhisattva

RAZOR BOY
I hear you are singing a song of the past
I see no tears
I know that you know it may be the last
For many years
You'd gamble or give anything
To be in with the better half
But how many friends must I have
To begin with to make you laugh

Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day

You know that the coming is so close at hand
You feel all right
I guess only women in cages can stand
This kind of night
I guess only women in cages
Can play down
The things they lose
You think no tomorrow will come
When you lay down
You can't refuse 

THE BOSTON RAG
Any news was good news
And the feeling was bad at home
I was out of mind and you
Were on the phone
Lonnie was the kingpin
Back in nineteen sixty-five
I was singing this song 
When Lonnie came alive

Bring back the Boston Rag
Tell all your buddies
That it ain't no drag
Bring back the Boston Rag

You were Lady Bayside
There was nothing that I could do
So I pointed my car down
Seventh Avenue
Lonnie swept the playroom
And he swallowed up all he found
It was forty-eight hours til
Lonnie came around

YOUR GOLD TEETH
Got a feeling I've been here before
Watching as you cross the killing floor
You know you'll have to pay it all
You'll pay today or pay tomorrow
You fasten up your beaded gown
Then you try to tie me down
Do you work it out one by one 
Or played in combination
You throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
I have seen your iron and your brass
Can't you see it shine behind the glass
Your fortune is your roving eye
Your mouth and legs
Your gift for the runaround
Torture is the main attraction
I don't need that kind of action
You don't have to dance for me
I've seen your dance before
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll

Tobacco they grow in Peking
In the Year of the Locust
You'll see a sad thing
Even Cathy Berberian knows
There's one roulade she can't sing
Dumb luck my friend
Won't suck me in this time

Got a feeling I've been here before
Won't you let me help you find the door
All you got to do is use
Your silver shoes
A gift for the runaround
Use your knack darlin'
Take one step back darlin'
There ain't nothing in Chicago
For a monkey woman to do
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll

SHOW BIZ KIDS

While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
After closing time
At the Guernsey Fair
I detect the El Supremo
From the room at the top of the stairs
Well I've been around the world
And I've been in the Washington Zoo
And in all my travels
As the facts unravel
I've found this to be true

They got the house on the corner
With the rug inside
They got the booze they need
All that money can buy
They got the shapely bods
They got the Steely Dan T-shirt
And for the coup-de-gras
They're outrageous

Show biz kids making movies
Of themselves you know they
Don't give a f*** about anybody else

MY OLD SCHOOL
I remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes
When you put me on the Wolverine
Up to Annandale
It was still September
When your daddy was quite surprised
To find you with the working girls
In the county jail
I was smoking with the boys upstairs
When I heard about the whole affair
I said oh no
William and Mary won't do

Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school

Oleanders growing outside her door
Soon they're gonna be in bloom
Up in Annandale
I can't stand her
Doing what she did before
Living like a gypsy queen
In a fairy tale
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico
She said oh no
Guadalajara won't do

California tumbles into the sea
That'll be the day I go
Back to Annandale
Tried to warn you
About Chino and Daddy Gee
But I can't seem to get to you
Through the U.S. Mail
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico
She said oh no
Guadalajara won't do

PEARL OF THE QUARTER
On the water down in New Orleans
My baby's the pearl of the quarter
She's a charmer like you never seen 
Singing voulez vous
Where the sailor spend his hard-earned pay
Red beans and rice for a quarter
You can see her almost any day
singing voulez vous

And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her I love her so 
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go

I walked alone down the miracle mile
I met my baby by the shine of the martyr
She stole my heart with her Cajun smile
Singing voulez vous
She loved the million dollar words I say
She loved the candy and the flowers that I bought her
She said she loved me and was on her way
Singing voulez vous

KING OF THE WORLD
Hello one and all
Was it you I used to know
Can't you hear me call
On this old ham radio
All I got to say
I'm alive and feeling fine
If you come my way
You can share my poison wine

No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world
As far as I know

I don't want your bread
I don't need your helping hand
I can't be no savage
I can't be no highwayman
Show me where you are
You and I will spend this day
Driving in my car
Through the ruins of Santa Fe

I'm reading last year's papers
Although I don't know why
Assassins cons and rapers
Might as well die

If you come around
No more pain and no regrets
Watch the sun go brown
Smoking cobalt cigarettes
There's no need to hide
Taking things the easy way
If I stay inside
I might live til Saturday

PRETZEL LOGIC

RIKKI DON'T LOSE THAT NUMBER
We hear you're leaving, that's OK
I thought our little wild time had just begun
I guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run
But if you have a change of heart

Rikki don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

I have a friend in town, he's heard your name
We can go out driving on Slow Hand Row
We could stay inside and play games, I don't know
And you could have a change of heart

You tell yourself you're not my kind
But you don't even know your mind
And you could have a change of heart

NIGHT BY NIGHT
It's a beggars life, said the Queen of Spain 
But don't tell it to a poor man
'Cause he's got to kill for every thrill 
The best he can
Everywhere around me 
I see jealousy and mayhem 
Because no men have all their peace of mind 
To carry them
Well I don't really care 
If it's wrong or if it's right 
But until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night

When the joker tried to tell me 
I could cut it in this rube town
When he tried to hang that sign on me
I said Take it down
When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice 
They're gonna do it with a shotgun 
Yes, I'm cashing in this ten-cent life 
For another one

Well I ain't got the heart 
To lose another fight 
So until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night

Well I don't really care 
If it's wrong or if it's right 
But until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night

ANY MAJOR DUDE WILL TELL YOU
I never seen you looking so bad my funky one
You tell me that your superfine mind has come undone

Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend 
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again 
When the demon is at your door 
In the morning it won't be there no more 
Any major dude will tell you

Have you ever seen a squonk's tears? Well, look at mine
The people on the street have all seen better times

I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do
You can try to run but you can't hide from what's inside of you

BARRYTOWN
I'm not one to look behind I know that times must change
But over there in Barrytown they do things very strange
And though you're not my enemy 
I like things like they used to be
And though you'd like some company 
I'm standing by myself
Go play with someone else
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown

Don't believe I'm taken in by stories I have heard 
I just read the Daily News and swear by every word 
And don't think that I'm out of line 
For speaking out for what is mine 
I'd like to see you do just fine
But look at what you wear 
And the way you cut your hair

I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown

In the beginning we recall that the word was hurled 
Barrytown people got to be from another world

Leave me or I'll be just like the others you will meet 
They won't act as kindly if they see you on the street 
And don't you scream or make a shout 
It's nothing you can do about 
It was there where you came out 
It's a special lack of grace 
I can see it in your face

I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown

PARKER'S BAND
Savoy sides presents a new saxophone sensation
It's Parker's band with a smooth style of syncopation
Kansas City born and growing 
You won't believe what the boys are blowing
You got to come on man 
And take a piece of Mister Parker's band

You'll be riding by, bareback on your armadillo 
You'll be grooving high or relaxing at Camarillo 
Suddenly the music hits you 
It's a bird in flight that just can't quit you

You got to come on man 
And take a piece of Mister Parker's band

We will spend a dizzy weekend smacked into a trance
Me and you will listen to 
A little bit of what made the preacher dance

Bring your horn along and you can add to the pure confection 
And if you can't fly you'll have to move in with the rhythm section
Either way you're bound to function 
Fifty-Second Street's the junction

You got to come on man 
And take a piece of Mister Parker's
Clap your hands and take a piece of Mister Parker's
Come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band

THROUGH WITH BUZZ
He takes all my money
You know I'm through with Buzz 
Yes I'm through with Buzz, 
All right, oh yeah, uh huh
He's not very funny 
You know I'm through with Buzz 
Yes I'm through with Buzz, 
All right, oh yeah, uh huh

I remember when he stole my girl 
Drug her all around the world
You know I'm cool, yes I feel alright 
'Cept when I'm in my room and it's late at night

Maybe he's a fairy
You know I'm through with Buzz 
Yes I'm through with Buzz 
All right, oh yeah, uh huh, all right

PRETZEL LOGIC
I would love to tour the Southland 
In a travelling minstrel show 
Yes I'd love to tour the Southland 
In a traveling minstrel show 
Yes I'm dying to be a star and make them laugh 
Sound just like a record on the phonograph 
Those days are gone forever 
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time 
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time 
'Cause he looks so fine upon that hill 
They tell me he was lonely, he's lonely still
Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah

I stepped up on the platform 
The man gave me the news
He said, You must be joking son 
Where did you get those shoes?
Where did you get those shoes?

Well, I've seen 'em on the TV, the movie show 
They say the times are changing but I just don't know 
These things are gone forever 
Over a long time ago, oh yeah

WITH A GUN
I could be wrong but I have seen your face before 
You were the man that I saw running from his door 
You owed him money but you gave him something more
With a gun
With a gun 
You will be what you are just the same 
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand 
And leave him lying in the rain?

You were the founders of the clinic on the hill 
Until he caught you with your fingers in the till 
He slapped your hand so you settled up your bill

With a gun
With a gun 
You will be what you are just the same 
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand 
And leave him lying in the rain?

When you're born to play the fool 
And you've seen all the western movies 
Woe to the one who does you wrong 
You hide in the bushes 
Murder the man 
With Luger in hand

I understood that you will soon be leavin' town 
Don't try to call me when they finally run you down 
Just give fair warning any time you come around

With a gun
With a gun 
You will be what you are just the same 
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand 
And leave him lying in the rain?

CHARLIE FREAK
Charlie Freak had but one thing to call his own 
Three weight ounce pure golden ring no precious stone 
Five nights without a bite 
No place to lay his head 
And if nobody takes him in 
He'll soon be dead
On the street he spied my face I heard him hail 
In our plot of frozen space he told his tale 
Poor man, he showed his hand
So righteous was his need 
And me so wise I bought his prize 
For chicken feed

Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind 
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind 
Poor kid, he overdid
Embraced the spreading haze 
And while he sighed his body died 
In fifteen ways

When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay 
'Round his arm the plastic tag read D.O.A. 
Yes Jack, I gave it back
The ring I could not own 
Now come my friend I'll take your hand 
And lead you home

MONKEY IN YOUR SOUL
I got one and you want four
It's so hard to help you 
I can't keep up with you no more
And you treat me like it's a sin 
But you can't lock me in 
You want me here with you right to the end 
No thank you my friend
I fear the monkey in your soul

Won't you turn that bebop down
I can't hear my heart beat
Where's that fatback chord I found? 
Honey don't you think it was wrong 
To interrupt my song? 
I'll pack my things and run so far from here
Goodbye dear

I fear the monkey in your soul

KATY LIED

BLACK FRIDAY
When Black Friday comes
I'll stand down by the door
And catch the grey men when they
Dive from the fourteenth floor 
When Black Friday comes
I'll collect everything I'm owed
And before my friends find out 
I'll be on the road
When Black Friday falls you know it's got to be
Don't let it fall on me
When Black Friday comes
I'll fly down to Muswellbrook
Gonna strike all the big red words
From my little black book
Gonna do just what I please
Gonna wear no socks and shoes
With nothing to do but feed
All the kangaroos
When Black Friday comes I'll be on that hill
You know I will

When Black Friday comes
I'm gonna dig myself a hole
Gonna lay down in it 'til
I satisfy my soul
Gonna let the world pass by me
The Archbishop's gonna sanctify me
And if he don't come across
I'm gonna let it roll
When Black Friday comes
I'm gonna stake my claim
I'll guess I'll change my name

BAD SNEAKERS
Five names that I can hardly
Stand to hear 
Including yours and mine
And one more chimp who isn't here
I can see the ladies talking
How the times are getting hard
And that fearsome excavation
On Magnolia Boulevard
CHORUS:
And I'm going insane
And I'm laughing at the frozen rain
And I'm so alone
Honey when they gonna send me home 
Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada
My friend
Stompin' on the avenue
By Radio City with a
Transistor and a large
Sum of money to spend

You fellah, you tearin' up the street
You wear that white tuxedo
How you gonna beat the heat
Do you take me for a fool
Do you think that I don't see
That ditch out in the valley
That they're digging just for me

ROSE DARLING
Rose darling come to me
Snake Mary's gone to bed
All our steaming sounds of love
Cannot disturb her in her night
Or raise her sleeping head
All I ask of you
Is make my wildest dreams come true
No one sees and no one knows
Rose darling come to me
Snake Mary dreams along
I would guess she's in Detroit
With lots of money in the bank
Although I could be wrong
You must know it's right
The spore is on the wind tonight
You won't feel it till it grows

Rose darling my friend
With only you and what I've found
We'll wear the weary hours down

Rose darling come to me
The clock is close at hand
All my empty words of love
Can never screen the flash I feel
Or make you understand
Honey can't you see
I know it's real it's got to be
Why not chase it where it goes

DADDY DON'T LIVE IN THAT NEW YORK CITY NO MORE
Daddy don't live in that New York City
No more
He don't celebrate Sunday on a Saturday night
No more
Daddy don't need no lock and key
For the piece he stowed
Out on Avenue D
Daddy don't live in that New York City
No more
Daddy don't drive in that Eldorado
No more
He don't travel on down to the neighborhood
Liquor store
Lucy still loves her coke and rum
But she sits alone
'Cause her daddy can't come
Daddy don't drive in that Eldorado
No more

Driving like a fool out to Hackensack
Drinking his dinner from a paper sack
He says I gotta see a joker
And I'll be right back

Daddy don't live in that New York City
No more
He can't get tight every night
Pass out on the barroom floor
Daddy can't get no fine cigar
But we know you're smoking
Wherever you are
Daddy don't live in that New York City
No more

DR WU
Katy tried
I was halfway crucified
I was on the other side
Of no tomorrow
You walked in
And my life began again
Just when I'd spent the last piaster
I could borrow
All night long
We would sing that stupid song
And every word we sang
I knew was true
Are you with me Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
Are you crazy are you high
Or just an ordinary guy
Have you done all you can do
Are you with me Doctor

Don't seem right
I've been strung out here all night
I've been waiting for the taste
You said you'd bring to me
Biscayne Bay
Where the Cuban gentlemen sleep all day
I went searching for the song
You used to sing to me
Katy lies
You could see it in her eyes
But imagine my surprise
When I saw you

Are you with me Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
She is lovely yes she's sly
And you're an ordinary guy
Has she finally got to you
Can you hear me Doctor

EVERYONE'S GONE TO THE MOVIES
Kids if you want some fun
Mr. LaPage is your man
He's always laughing, having fun
Showing his films in the den
Come on, come on
Soon you will be eighteen
I think you know what I mean
Don't tell your mama
Your daddy or mama
They'll never know where you been

Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last

Listen to what I say
He wants to show you the way
Right down the hallway with open arms
To teach you a new game to play
Come on, come on
Soon it will be too late
Bobbing for apples can wait
We know you're used to sixteen or more
Sorry we only have eight

Kids if you want some fun
See what you never have seen
Take off your cheaters and sit right down
Start the projection machine

YOUR GOLD TEETH II
Who are these children
Who scheme and run wild
Who speak with their wings
And the way that they smile
What are the secrets
They trace in the sky
And why do you tremble
Each time they ride by

Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal
Life is unreal

Who are these strangers
Who pass through the door
Who cover your action
And go you one more
If you're feeling lucky
You best not refuse
It's your game the rules
Are your own win or lose

CHAIN LIGHTNING
Some turnout, a hundred grand
Get with it we'll shake his hand
Don't bother to understand
Don't question the little man
Be part of the brotherhood
Yes it's chain lightning
It feels so good
Hush brother, we cross the square
Act natural like you don't care
Turn slowly and comb your hair
Don't trouble the midnight air
We're standing just where he stood
It was chain lightning
It feels so good

ANY WORLD (THAT I'M WELCOME TO)
If I had my way
I would move to another lifetime
I'd quit my job
Ride the train through the misty nighttime
I'll be ready when my feet touch ground
Wherever I come down
And if the folks will have me
Then they'll have me

Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from

I can hear your words
When you speak of what you are and have seen
I can see your hand
Reaching out through a shining daydream
Where the days and nights are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame
Honey I will be there
Yes I'll be there

I got this thing inside me
That's got to find a place to hide me
I only know I must obey
This feeling I can't explain away

I think I'll go to the park
Watch the children playing
Perhaps I'll find in my head
What my heart is saying
A vision of a child returning
A kingdom where the sky is burning
Honey I will be there
Yes I'll be there

THROW BACK THE LITTLE ONES
Lost in the Barrio I walk like an Injun
So Carlo won't suspect something's wrong here
I dance in place
And paint my face
And act like I belong here
CHORUS:
Throw back the little ones
And pan-fry the big ones
Use tact, poise and reason
And gently squeeze them

Hot licks and rhetoric
Don't count much for nothing
Be glad if you can use what you borrow
So I pawn my crown
For a ride uptown
And buy it back tomorrow

Done like a matador I pray for the weekend
And hope the little girls still throw roses
Else I'll change my bait
And move upstate
Before the season closes

THE ROYAL SCAM

KID CHARLEMAGNE
While the music played you worked by candlelight 
Those San Francisco nights 
You were the best in town 
Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl 
You turned it on the world 
That's when you turned the world around
Did you feel like Jesus 
Did you realize 
That you were a champion in their eyes
On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene 
But yours was kitchen clean 
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home 
Every A-Frame had your number on the wall 
You must have had it all 
You'd go to L.A. on a dare 
And you'd go it alone 
Could you live forever 
Could you see the day 
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away

Get along, get along Kid Charlemagne 
Get along Kid Charlemagne

Now your patrons have all left you in the red 
Your low rent friends are dead 
This life can be very strange 
All those dayglow freaks who used to paint the face 
They've joined the human race 
Some things will never change 
Son you were mistaken 
You are obsolete 
Look at all the white men on the street

Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail 
Those test tubes and the scale 
Just get them all out of here 
Is there gas in the car 
Yes, there's gas in the car 
I think the people down the hall 
Know who you are

Careful what you carry 
'Cause the man is wise 
You are still an outlaw in their eyes

CAVES OF ALTAMIRA
I recall when I was small 
How I spent my days alone 
The busy world was not for me 
So I went and found my own 
I would climb the garden wall 
With a candle in my hand 
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand
On the stone an ancient hand 
In a faded yellow-green 
Made alive a worldly wonder 
Often told but never seen 
Now and ever bound to labor 
On the sea and in the sky 
Every man and beast appeared 
A friend as real as I

Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall 
When there wasn't even any Hollywood 
They heard the call 
And they wrote it on the wall 
For you and me we understood

Can it be this sad design 
Could be the very same 
A wooly man without a face 
And a beast without a name 
Nothin' here but history 
Can you see what has been done 
Memory rush over me 
Now I step into the sun

DON'T TAKE ME ALIVE
Agents of the law 
Luckless pedestrian 
I know you're out there 
With rage in your eyes and your megaphones 
Saying all is forgiven 
Mad Dog surrender 
How can I answer 
A man of my mind can do anything

I'm a bookkeeper's son 
I don't want to shoot no one 
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon 
Don't take me alive 
Got a case of dynamite 
I could hold out here all night 
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon 
Don't take me alive

Can you hear the evil crowd 
The lies and the laughter 
I hear my inside 
The mechanized hum of another world 
Where no sun is shining 
No red light flashing 
Here in this darkness 
I know what I've done 
I know all at once who I am

SIGN IN STRANGER
Have you heard about the boom on Mizar Five 
People got to shout to stay alive 
They don't even have policeman one 
Doesn't matter where you been or what you've done 
Do you have a dark spot on your past 
Leave it to my man he'll fix it fast 
Pepe has a scar from ear to ear 
He will make your mug shots disappear

You zombie 
Be born again my friend 
Won't you sign in stranger

Do you like to take a yo-yo for a ride 
Zombie I can see you're qualified 
Walk around collecting Turkish union dues 
They will call you sir and shine your shoes 
Or maybe you would like to see the show 
You'll enjoy the Cafe D'Escargot 
Folks are in a line around the block 
Just to see her do the can-can-Jacques

Love or leave her, yellow fever 
Sure, it's all in the game 
And who are you 
Just another scurvy brother

THE FEZ
No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on 
Oh no 
No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no 
That's what I am 
Please understand 
I wanna be your holy man
No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on 
Oh no 
Ain't never gonna do it without the fez on 
Oh no 
That's what I am 
Please understand 
I wanna be your holy man

No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on 
Oh no 
Don't make me do it without the fez on 
Oh no 
That's what I am please understand

GREEN EARRINGS
Cold, daring 
No flies on me 
Sorry, angel 
I must take what I see
Green earrings 
I remember 
The rings of rare design 
I remember 
The look in your eyes 
I don't mind

Greek medallion 
Sparkles when you smile 
Sorry, angel 
I get hungry like a child

Green earrings 
I remember 
The rings of rare design 
I remember 
The look in your eyes 
I don't mind

HAITIAN DIVORCE
Babs and Clean Willie were in love they said 
So in love the preacher's face turned red 
Soon everybody knew the thing was dead 
He shouts, she bites, they wrangle through the night
She go crazy 
Got to make a getaway 
Papa say

Oh - no hesitation 
No tears and no hearts breakin' 
No remorse 
Oh - congratulations 
This is your Haitian Divorce

She takes the taxi to the good hotel 
Bon marché as far as she can tell 
She drinks the zombie from the cocoa shell 
She feels alright, she get it on tonight 
Mister driver 
Take me where the music play
Papa say

At the Grotto 
In the greasy chair 
Sits the Charlie with the lotion and the kinky hair 
When she smiled, she said it all 
The band was hot so 
They danced the famous Merengue 
Now we dolly back 
Now we fade to black

Tearful reunion in the USA 
Day by day those memories fade away 
Some babies grow in a peculiar way 
It changed, it grew, and everybody knew 
Semi-mojo 
Who's this kinky so-and-so? 
Papa go

EVERYTHING YOU DID
Where did the bastard run 
Is he still around 
Now you gotta tell me everything you did baby 
I'm gonna get a gun 
Shoot the lover down 
Are you gonna tell me everything you did baby
Traces are everywhere 
In our happy home 
Now you better tell me everything you did baby 
I jumped out of my easy chair 
It was not my own 
Now I want to hear about everything you did baby

I never knew you 
You were a roller skater 
You gonna show me later 
Turn up the Eagles the neighbors are listening

You know how people talk 
I wonder what they say 
I think you better tell me everything you did baby

I never knew you 
You were a roller skater 
You gonna show me later

You never came to me 
When you were so inclined 
Yes you could have told me everything you did baby 
I know where baby's at 
I know your filthy mind 
Now you're gonna do me everything you did baby

THE ROYAL SCAM
And they wandered in 
From the city of St. John 
Without a dime 
Wearing coats that shined 
Both red and green
Colors from their sunny island 
From their boats of iron 
They looked upon the promised land 
Where surely life was sweet 
On the rising tide 
To New York City 
Did they ride into the street
See the glory
Of the royal scam

They are hounded down 
To the bottom of a bad town 
Amid the ruins 
Where they learn to fear 
An angry race of fallen kings 
Their dark companions 
While the memory of 
Their southern sky was clouded by 
A savage winter 
Every patron saint 
Hung on the wall, shared the room 
With twenty sinners

See the glory
Of the royal scam

By the blackened wall 
He does it all 
He thinks he's died and gone to heaven 
Now the tale is told 
By the old man back home
He reads the letter 
How they are paid in gold 
Just to babble in the back room 
All night and waste their time 
And they wandered in 
From the city of St. John without a dime

See the glory
Of the royal scam

AJA

BLACK COW
In the corner 
Of my eye 
I saw you in Rudy's 
You were very high 
You were high 
It was a cryin' disgrace 
They saw your face 

On the counter 
By your keys 
Was a book of numbers 
And your remedies 
One of these 
Surely will screen out the sorrow 
But where are you tomorrow

I can't cry anymore 
While you run around 
Break away 
Just when it 
Seems so clear 
That it's 
Over now 
Drink your big black cow 
And get out of here

Down to Greene Street 
There you go 
Lookin' so outrageous 
And they tell you so 
You should know 
How all the pros play the game 
You change your name 

Like a gangster 
On the run 
You will stagger homeward 
To your precious one 
I'm the one 
Who must make everything right 
Talk it out till daylight 

I don't care anymore 
Why you run around 
Break away 
Just when it 
Seems so clear 
That it's 
Over now 
Drink your big black cow 
And get out of here

AJA
Up on the hill 
People never stare 
They just don't care 
Chinese music under banyan trees 
Here at the dude ranch above the sea 
Aja 
When all my dime dancin' is through 
I run to you 

Up on the hill 
They've got time to burn 
There's no return 
Double helix in the sky tonight 
Throw out the hardware
Let's do it right 
Aja 
When all my dime dancin' is through 
I run to you 

Up on the hill 
They think I'm okay
Or so they say 
Chinese music always sets me free 
Angular banjoes 
Sound good to me 
Aja 
When all my dime dancin' is through 
I run to you

DEACON BLUES
This is the day 
Of the expanding man 
That shape is my shade 
There where I used to stand 
It seems like only yesterday 
I gazed through the glass 
At ramblers 
Wild gamblers 
That's all in the past 

You call me a fool 
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real 
I already bought the dream 
So useless to ask me why 
Throw a kiss and say goodbye 
I'll make it this time 
I'm ready to cross that fine line 

I'll learn to work the saxophone 
I'll play just what I feel 
Drink Scotch whisky all night long 
And die behind the wheel 
They got a name for the winners in the world 
I want a name when I lose 
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide 
Call me Deacon Blues 

My back to the wall 
A victim of laughing chance 
This is for me 
The essence of true romance 
Sharing the things we know and love 
With those of my kind 
Libations 
Sensations
That stagger the mind 

I crawl like a viper 
Through these suburban streets 
Make love to these women 
Languid and bittersweet 
I'll rise when the sun goes down 
Cover every game in town 
A world of my own 
I'll make it my home sweet home 

This is the night
Of the expanding the man 
I take one last drag 
As I approach the stand 
I cried when I wrote this song 
Sue me if I play too long 
This brother is free 
I'll be what I want to be

PEG
I've seen your picture 
Your name in lights above it 
This is your big debut 
It's like a dream come true 
So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it 

I like your pin shot 
I keep it with your letter 
Done up in blueprint blue 
It sure looks good on you 
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better 

Peg
It will come back to you 
Peg
It will come back to you 
Then the shutter falls 
You see it all in 3-D 
It's your favorite foreign movie

HOME AT LAST
I know this super highway 
This bright familiar sun 
I guess that I'm the lucky one 
Who wrote that tired sea song 
Set on this peaceful shore 
You think you've heard this one before 

Well the danger on the rocks is surely past 
Still I remain tied to the mast 
Could it be that I have found my home at last 
Home at last 

She serves the smooth retsina 
She keeps me safe and warm 
It's just the calm before the storm 
Call in my reservation 
So long hey thanks my friend 
I guess I'll try my luck again 

Well the danger on the rocks is surely past 
Still I remain tied to the mast 
Could it be that I have found my home at last 
Home at last

I GOT THE NEWS
You 
In your Lark 
You're a mark 
You're a screamer 
You know 
How to hustle 
Daddy
Is a rare 
Millionaire 
I don't care 
Yeah you 
Got the muscle 
I got the news 

Yes dear 
How did you know 
Can't you see our love will grow

Take it 
In your hand 
All the sirens 
And the band 
Get to bendin' my ear 
How 
Was I to know 
About the warm 
Soulful secret 
You been keepin' for years
I got the news 

Slow down I'll tell you when 
I may never walk again 

Broadway Duchess 
Darling if you only knew 
Half as much as 
Everybody thinks you do 
What I hear 
May be true 
I would still be proud 
To know you 

Spanish kissin' 
See it glisten 
You came ragin' 
Love rampagin' 
I got the news 

Yes dear 
How did you know 
Can't you see our love will grow

JOSIE
We're gonna break out the hats and hooters 
When Josie comes home 
We're gonna rev up the motor scooters 
When Josie comes home to stay 
We're gonna park in the street 
Sleep on the beach and make it 
Throw down the jam till the girls say when 
Lay down the law and break it 
When Josie comes home 

When Josie comes home 
So good 
She's the pride of the neighborhood 
She's the raw flame 
The live wire 
She prays like a Roman 
With her eyes on fire 

Jo would you love to scrapple
She'll never say no 
Shine up the battle apple 
We'll shake 'em all down tonight 
We're gonna mix in the street 
Strike at the stroke of midnight 
Dance on the bones till the girls say when 
Pick up what's left by daylight 
When Josie comes home

When Josie comes home 
So bad 
She's the best friend we ever had 
She's the raw flame 
The live wire 
She prays like a Roman 
With her eyes on fire 

When Josie comes home 
So good 
She's the pride of the neighborhood 
She's the raw flame 
The live wire 
She prays like a Roman 
With her eyes on fire
